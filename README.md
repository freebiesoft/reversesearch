# reversesearch
I am currently working on the documentation and other writings about this project (this should be finished by 24/01/2020)

As a very brief explanation of the project: This searches log files in reverse for matching log entries against time constraints and other match criteria. This is suited for scenarios where large log files need to be searched, and you know that the logs you need information for are within the last X amount of (relatively) short period of time ago. The program works seamlessly for multiline logs also. This is only the beginning of the project and the vision where I want this to go will be uploaded shortly.

One of the main motives of starting this short project was for me to learn TDD and to develop my Go programming skills.

As you will see, most of the code is tests. That's because this is very bug prone code!

For now the examples/ directory is the best place to have a look at how things work (it's short and simple)!
